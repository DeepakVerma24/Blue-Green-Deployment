# üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps ‚Äì AWS Blue‚ÄìGreen Deployment Model

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create EC2 Instances
- Launch **4 EC2 instances** (Red Hat).
- 2 in subnet 1a and 2 in subnet 1b.
- upload shell script that downloads template or application from internet of two versions for all the instances.
- Open inbound ports 80 (HTTP) & 443 (HTTPS)
-check whether templates are accessible through instance ip address.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Target Groups
- Go to EC2 ‚Üí Target Groups ‚Üí Create
- blue-tg ‚Üí attach Blue EC2 instance
- green-tg ‚Üí attach Green EC2 instance
- Set health check path as /index.html

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Type: Internet-facing
- Add both target groups
- Configure listeners:
1.Port 80 ‚Üí HTTP (redirect to HTTPS)
2.Port 443 ‚Üí HTTPS (with ACM certificate)
- Default target: blue-tg

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Route 53
- Create a hosted zone (your domain)
- Add an A Record ‚Üí Alias ‚Üí ALB DNS
- Your website is now accessible via custom domain

5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable SSL with AWS ACM
- Go to AWS Certificate Manager
- Request certificate for your domain
- Validate using Route 53 DNS records
- Attach the certificate to ALB listener (HTTPS 443)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Blue‚ÄìGreen Switch
- Test new (Green) environment directly
- Once verified, update ALB listener:
- Forward all traffic to green-tg
- Check DNS and verify successful switch (zero downtime)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Rollback (if required)
- If an issue occurs, reassign ALB listener to blue-tg
- Restore old version instantly

‚úÖ Outcome

Successfully switched from Photography version to Purplebuzz version with zero runtime using AWS Blue‚ÄìGreen Deployment.
